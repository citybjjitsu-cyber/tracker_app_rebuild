# CKB Tracker — Pre-Launch Rollout Plan

**Goal:** Resolve all identified issues before limited user testing.
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend). Each phase merged to `main` auto-deploys.
**Process per phase:** Feature branch → implement → test locally → commit → push → PR → merge to main → verify on Vercel.
